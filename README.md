#:computer: Computer Science and Web Development - comprehensive

**Note:** [From :computer: Guide: Computer Science and Web Development - comprehensive path] (https://trello.com/b/4v9dpn3G/cs-wd).

## Prerequisite

The **only things** that you need to know are how to use **Git** and **GitHub**. Here are some resources to learn about them:

**Note**: Just pick one of the courses below to learn the basics. You will learn a lot more once you get started!

- [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
- [Git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
- [GitHub Training & Guides](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg7s6cbtAD15G8lNyoaYDuKZSKyJrgwB-)
- [GitHub Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
- [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/index.html)
- [How to Use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)

**There WILL be math. And, it's important. If the thought frightens you, or bores you, or has you thinking "this isn't for me", head to [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) right now, sign up, and start devoting 30 minutes a day. This is an investment that will pay off. I'm not making this up.**

## Bookmarks you should have
* [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/) - deploy your frontend projects here (or use github pages)
* [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - look HTML, CSS, and JavaScript stuff up here
* [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) - deploy your fullstack projects here (or hyperdev)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) or [mLab](https://mlab.com/) - database hosting
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - store your code here
* [Material Design](https://material.google.com) - lean on this when you need a structure for creating a minimalistic but awesome looking site
* [Material Palette](https://www.materialpalette.com/) - for selecting color schemes
* [Wirify](https://www.wirify.com/) - for quickly turning a web page into a wireframe so you can see the big picture instead of all the graphics

## Things to keep in mind

* have git commits every week, most of the days of the week
* try to get in one of @tropicalchancer's cohorts - be active once you're in
* try to pick one to two other languages to use regularly for solving algorithms and implementing projects in addition to JavaScript (good choices would be to pick one of C++, Java or Python and one of Golang or Rust).

#### For each item you should:

* take notes, on a blog, in markdown, wherever, somewhere - not about what you read, or about what the instructor said - about what you learned
* build something - even if it's just a 20 line function that computes something you find interesting
* if you build something, document it and test it as appropriate
* do the exercises, build the projects - fully, not some scaled down halfassery

#### For four projects of your choosing

* Seek 1-3 other developers to collaborate on the project
* Coordinate with the team to complete the project
* Build the project out to a full production quality application
* Invite others who are not associated with the team to rigorously test the final product.
* Resolve any legitimate issues found

#### Once per month - do two or more of the following:

* Write up a comprehensive blog post or markdown entry in a repository detailing the high points of what you learned that month
* Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NIb9l3imAo) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5-tdAwclo) - on interviewing
* Read [this](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.co.uk/2007_09_01_archive.html) - on crafting a resume
* Do one lesson from [CUST104: Business Communications](https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=345)
* Live stream what you're working on for an hour. Or, lend a hand to someone who needs help by screensharing and walking them through it.
* Catch up on industry reading on sites like [Joel on Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/), [Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/), [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/), [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/articles), [UX Myths](http://uxmyths.com/), [JavaScript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/)

#### If you need a breather from an item, do one of these, then get back to it

* complete a project from FCC that isn't included in this list
* pick a pet web development project you can code in a week and complete it
* code another android application
* write a guide for the FCC wiki or create a video tutorial and post it to YouTube
* learn golang or rust and complete any of the backend projects from FCC with that language as the backend language
* redo any of the algorithmic type projects you've already completed from the list, in a language other than JavaScript
* pick an open source project from [Code Triage](https://www.codetriage.com/) and contribute to fixing an open issue
* visit the FCC forum and pick a couple of the toughest questions, that people are having trouble getting help with, and help them
* code a flash cards application, for jotting quick notes you can use to quiz yourself later
