## Goals

* Join one of the Chingu cohorts that @tropicalchancer puts together and actively participate on one or more group projects
* Contribute one pull request per month to an open source project of your choosing.
* When working through a book, type out the example code and do all the exercises.
* When working through a course, do all the assignments.
* When building a Project, include a built process (like [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)), include at least 5 automated tests ([Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html), [mocha](https://mochajs.org/), sinon, chai, jasmine, tape, whatever works), include a README.md file that clearly explains the project, and practice using [meaningful 
commit messages](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) 
* Use each project to demonstrate that you can deliver an optimized product. Implement tests, use your build process to minimize assets, use a linter (like [ESLint](http://eslint.org/)) on your JavaScript and use [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/).

#### For each item you should:

* make a blog post about what you learned (and not just read)
* build something (even if it's a 20 lines function that computes something you find interesting)
* document it and test it as appropriate
* do the exercises, build the projects - fully, not some scaled down halfassery

#### For four projects

* Seek 1-3 other developers to collaborate on the project
* Coordinate with the team to complete the project
* Build the project out to a full production quality application
* Invite others who are not associated with the team to rigorously test the final product.
* Resolve any legitimate issues found

#### Once a month:

* Write up a comprehensive blog post or markdown entry in a repository detailing the high points of what you learned that month
* Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NIb9l3imAo) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5-tdAwclo) - on interviewing
* Read [this](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.co.uk/2007_09_01_archive.html) - on crafting a resume
* Do one lesson from [CUST104: Business Communications](https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=345)
* Lend a hand to someone who needs help by screensharing and walking them through it.
* Catch up on industry reading on sites like [Joel on Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/), [Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/), [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/), [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/articles), [UX Myths](http://uxmyths.com/), [JavaScript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/)
