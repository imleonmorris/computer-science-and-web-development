// Statements

- Statements perform a specific task:

    a = b * 2;

Key terms:
- statement - a combo of the following to perform a specific task:
- variable - store values (symbolic placeholder)
- literal value - just stands alone outside of a variable
- operators - perform actions with the values

-> end JS statements with a ;

// Expressions

This statement has four expressions:

    a = b * 2;

Key terms:
- expression - set of variable(s) and value(s) combined with operators

-> There is such a thing as an expression statement (not common as a bit useless):

    b * 2;

-> More common are call expression statements:

    alert ( a );

// Exceuting a programming

- a program can be run top to bottom (interpreting).
- a program could be translated ahead of time (compiling) in order to run later.
- People usually assert that JS is interpreted but it's not quite true.
- JS compiles and then runs the compiled code immediately.

// Output

    console.log( b );

    -> log( b ) is a function.
    -> console. is an object reference.

// Input

    prompt( "..." );

// Operators

Keywords:
- Assignment: =
- Math: +, -, *, /
- Compound assignment: +=, -=, *=, /=
- Increment/decrement: ++, --
- Object property access: .
- Equality: ==, ===, !=, !==
- Comparison: <, >, <=, >=
- Logical: &&, ||

// Values & Types

Types:
- number: 42;
- string: "I am a string";
- boolean: true;

-> Converting a number into a string is known as coercion.
-> Can use number (..); Known as explicit coercion.
-> Implicit coercion: "99.99" == 99.99 -> turns into 99.99 == 99.99.
-> Implicit coercion is tricky to master but it is important to recognise the rules.

// Code comments

- No comments is suboptimal
- Too many is poorly written code
- Explain why, not what.
- Perhaps explain how as well.

-> // Single comment (useful for the end of a statement or line)
-> /* Multi line comment */ (useful for descriptive explanation)

// Variables

vary-ables -> amirite?

- JS uses dynamic typing, as opposed to static typing (type enforcement).
- Static is when a variable should hold a specific type only (like Swift).
- Dynamic is when a var type can actually change - this is more flexible.

    var amount = 99.99;

    amount = amount * 2;

    console.log( amount );  // 199.98

    // convert 'amount' to a string, and
    // add "$" on the beginning
    amount = "$" + String( amount );

    console.log( amount );  /"$199.98"

-> First amount is implicitly coerced to log amount to the console ยง199.98
-> Then amount is explicitly coerced to a string and converted to "$199.98".

// Constants

- Typically, these are placed at the top of a program (easier to edit)
- Usually in CAPS

    var TAX_RATE = 0.08; // 8% sales tax

    var amount = 99.99;

    amount = amount * 2;

    amount = amount + (amount * TAX_RATE);

    console.log( amount );              // 215.9784
    console.log( amount.toFixed( 2 ) ); // "215.98"

-> toFixed(..) specifies how many decimal places.

NB: ES6 lets us declare constants using const instead of var:

    // as of ES6:
    const TAX_RATE = 0.08;

    var amount = 9.99;

    // ..

// Blocks

- We block a series of JS statements in {..}

    var amount = 99.99;

    // a general block
    {
        amount = amount * 2;
        console.log( amount );  // 199.98
    }

- NB: Typically, blocks are attached to a control statement (e.g. if statements).

    var amount = 99.99;

    // is amount big enough?
    if (amount > 10) {
        amount = amount * 2;
        console.log( amount );  // 199.98
    }

-> The statements inside the block will only run if amount > 10 (it is attached.)

// Conditionals

1. if statements
2. if..else statements
3. switch statement
4. loops

    // 1. if statements

    var bank_balance = 302.13;
    vara amount = 99.99;

    if (amount < bank_balance) {
        console.log( "I want to buy this phone!" );
    }

    // 2. is..else statements

    -> else clauses can be added if the condition is false:

    const ACCESSORY_PRICE = 9.99;

    var bank_balance = 302.13;
    var amount = 99.99;

    amount = amount * 2;

    // can we afford the extra purchase?
    if ( amount < bank_balance ) {
        console.log( "I'll take the accessory!" );
        amount = amount + ACCESSORY_PRICE;
    }
    // otherwise:
    else {
        console.log( "No, thanks." );
    }

    // 3. switch statements

        -> These will be discussed later

    // 4. loops

        - includes a test condition and a block.
        - Each time the loop block executes is an interation.

        -> while loops
        -> do..while loops - always performs one iteration
        -> for loops

        while (numOfCustomers > 0) {
            console.log( "How may I help you?" );

            // help the customer

            numOfCustomers = numOfCustomer - 1;
        }

        // versus:

        do {
            console.log( "How may I help you?" );

            // help the customer...

            numOfCustomers = numOfCustomers - 1;
        } while (numOfCustomers > 0);

        // for loops

        These offer a significant amount of control and simplicity:

        for (var i = 0; i <= 9, i += 1) {
            console.log( i );
        }
        // 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

        -> three clauses:
            1. initilisation (var i=0)
            2. condition (i <= 9)
            3. update (i += 1)
