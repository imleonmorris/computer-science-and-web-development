// Statements

- Statements perform a specific task:

    a = b * 2;

Key terms:
- statement - a combo of the following to perform a specific task:
- variable - store values (symbolic placeholder)
- literal value - just stands alone outside of a variable
- operators - perform actions with the values

-> end JS statements with a ;

// Expressions

This statement has four expressions:

    a = b * 2;

Key terms:
- expression - set of variable(s) and value(s) combined with operators

-> There is such a thing as an expression statement (not common as a bit useless):

    b * 2;

-> More common are call expression statements:

    alert ( a );

// Exceuting a programming

- a program can be run top to bottom (interpreting).
- a program could be translated ahead of time (compiling) in order to run later.
- People usually assert that JS is interpreted but it's not quite true.
- JS compiles and then runs the compiled code immediately.
