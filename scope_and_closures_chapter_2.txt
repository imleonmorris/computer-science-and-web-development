Chapter 2: Lexical Scope
A look at two types of Scope (Lexical and Dynamic). JS is lexical - it is author-timed.

1. Lex-time
    -> Scope look-up stops once it find the first match. It works inner-->outer.
    -> Possible to access global var using window e.g. window.a
2. Cheating Lexical (NB: poorer performance!)
    -> Two methods to cheat:
    1. eval() :  shortcut to add String. does not work in strict mode.
    2. with : deprecated.
    -> Engine assumes optimizations will be invalid and will run slower.
