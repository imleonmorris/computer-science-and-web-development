Chapter 4: Hoisting
    A look at declarations appearing in various locations WITHIN a scope.
1. Chicken Or The Egg?
    What comes first? The declaration (egg) or the assignment (chicken)?
2. The Compiler Strikes Again
    - All declarations (both vars & functions) processed FIRST.
    - Only declarations are hoisted.
    - Hoisting is PER-SCOPE.
    - Function declarations are hoisted - function expressions ARE NOT.
3. Functions First
    - Function decl are hoisted before var declarations.
    - Duplicate var decls are ignored but subsequent *function* decls DO override previous ones.
