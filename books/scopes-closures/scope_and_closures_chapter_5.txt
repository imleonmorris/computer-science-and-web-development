Chapter 5: Scope Closure

1. Enlightenment
    - Whatever.
2. Nitty Gritty
    - When a function remembers, and can access, its lexical scope - even when executing from OUTSIDE its lexical scope.
3. Now I Can See
4. Loops + Closure
5. Modules
    -> Modules are just functions
    -> Two requirements for the module pattern to be exercised:
        1. Outer enclosing function (invoked at least once)
        2. outer enclosing function must return back at least one inner function (so inner function has closure over the private scope and can access/modify it)





        for (var i=1; i<=5; i++) {
            setTimeout( function timer() {
                console.log( i );
            }, i* 1000 );
        }
